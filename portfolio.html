        <h3>Object Detection System</h4>
            Data Scientists who are just starting their careers can develop skills in the field of computer vision with
            this project. An object detection system can identify classes of objects present within an image by
            utilizing computer vision techniques in the background. For example, suppose an image contains a picture of
            you working on a laptop. In that case, an object detection system should be able to identify and label you
            (human) and the computer, along with your position in the image.

            Project Idea: You can use Kaggleâ€™s Open Images Object Detection dataset for this project. There is a
            pre-trained object detection model that has been made open-source called SSD. This model was trained on a
            dataset of everyday objects called COCO and can identify things like tables, chairs, and books. You can
            further train the output layer of this model on the Kaggle Open Images dataset to build your object
            detection system with high accuracy.

            Dataset: Kaggle Open Images Object Detection Dataset

            Tools and Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV</p>
